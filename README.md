# Underwater-Plastic-Detection-and-Cleaning-using-Computer-Vision-and-Deep-Learning

This project is Computer Vision and IOT based AUV for underwater garbage collection and cleaning.It uses tflite model for garbage detection with almost 80% accuracy.
The model is trained on 1500 images of 5 classes namely straws,bottle,cans,bags and cups.
An underwater autonomous vehicle capable of detecting underwater garbage using Image Processing and Keras
• The designed machine would be able to detect the plastic, calculate distance using sonar and OpenCV and then collect the detected garbage
using Robotic Arm.
• The collected garbage would be compressed in a compressor attached and would be collected in an attached net.
Further Work: 1.Augmentation and training model 2.Adding new classes of garbage

Model is trained on images and videos. Few examples of detecting underwater plastic are shown -
